Transform this flat lay outfit (second image) onto me (first image) wearing the complete look in natural lighting. Place all clothing items (second image) on my body (from image one) with proper fit and proportions, maintaining the original colors and fabric textures. Create a clean studio environment with soft shadows and professional photography quality. 
Ensure the outfit looks naturally worn with realistic draping and movement, keeping all garment details crisp and well-defined.
